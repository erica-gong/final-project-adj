This is my final project. 

I analyzed the health trends in Boone County, Missouri using the County Health Rankings & Roadmaps (CHR&R) National Data from 2015 to 2024. 

Published by the University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute, this dataset consists of separate annual Excel files and contains detailed measures of health outcomes and factors across all U.S. counties. Each file also has detailed documentation of variables and measurement methods. 
The original dataset is publicly available at https://www.countyhealthrankings.org/health-data/methodology-and-sources/data-documentation.

This project focused on data processing and statistical analysis. My goal is to use R to clean, merge, and analyze the yearly datasets, then compare health trends at county-level (Boone County, Missouri).

There are five main steps in my data analysis process.

Step1: Loading libraries and data
Step2: Checking data boundries, cleaning data, and joining tables
Step3: General Overview 
Step4: Analyzing data
Step5: Summary and future reporting
